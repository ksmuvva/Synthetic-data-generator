### Low Priority (Nice to Have)

9. **No Profile Management** (FR-9.2)
   - Can't save/load requirement profiles
   - **Impact:** Must re-enter requirements for similar datasets

10. **Limited Quality Metrics** (FR-7.3)
    - Only shows row count and column names
    - **Missing:** Completeness, uniqueness, validity metrics
    - **Impact:** Users can't assess data quality

11. **No Performance Benchmarks** (TR-5, TR-6)
    - No testing of scalability claims
    - **Impact:** Unknown if performance requirements are met

12. **Incomplete Logging** (TR-13.1, TR-13.3)
    - structlog configured but not fully utilized
    - **Impact:** Harder to debug production issues

## 7. Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next Sprint)

1. **Implement Session Resume** - Critical for user experience
2. **Add Excel Export** - Most requested format after CSV/JSON
3. **Add Parquet Export** - Important for big data workflows
4. **Implement Multi-Format Export** - Export same data to multiple formats

### Short Term (1-2 Months)

5. **Improve Pattern Matching** - Match distributions, not just statistics
6. **Add Foreign Key Support** - Enable relational dataset generation
7. **Implement Chunked Output** - Support large datasets (>1M rows)
8. **Add S3 Storage** - Most common cloud storage requirement

### Long Term (3+ Months)

9. **Build Plugin Architecture** - Enable extensibility
10. **Add Open-Source LLM Support** - Ollama/vLLM integration
11. **Comprehensive Quality Metrics** - Full data quality dashboard
12. **Performance Optimization** - Profiling and optimization

## 8. Conclusion

The Synthetic Data Generator CLI has achieved a **solid 68% compliance** with the comprehensive requirements specification. The system successfully implements all core functional workflows (requirement capture, ambiguity resolution, basic generation) and demonstrates strong architectural foundations with proper separation of concerns, robust error handling, and good security practices.

### Strengths
- ✅ Excellent LLM integration with retry and caching
- ✅ Comprehensive ambiguity detection and resolution
- ✅ Strong input validation and security

### Weaknesses
- ❌ Limited format support (only CSV/JSON)
- ❌ No cloud storage integration
- ❌ Session resume not functional
- ❌ Simplified pattern matching
- ❌ No plugin architecture

The system is **production-ready for MVP use cases** (CSV/JSON generation with basic requirements) but requires additional development for advanced features outlined in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the implementation plan.

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Fix session resume functionality
2. Add Excel and Parquet export
3. Implement multi-format export
4. Add comprehensive testing for scalability
5. Begin work on cloud storage integration
